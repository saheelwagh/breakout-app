Project: Decentralized Ads Exchange (Inspired by ONDC)
Goal: Create an open, standardized marketplace for digital ad inventory using tokenization on Solana.

1. Core Entities:
1. Publishers: Owners of websites or mobile apps with ad space available. They list their inventory on the exchange.
2. Advertisers: Marketers looking to buy ad space to run campaigns. They buy inventory tokens from the exchange.

3. The Exchange: The decentralized platform (built on Solana) where inventory tokens are listed, discovered, and traded.

4. Ad Inventory Tokens: Digital assets representing the right to display an ad in a specific space/context.

5. Oracle(s) (Likely Required): Trusted off-chain services needed for:

a.Verifying ad space details (e.g., typical traffic, audience demographics - simplified).

b. Confirming ad delivery (proof-of-impression/click). This is crucial for trust.

2. Ad Inventory Token - Initial Design Ideas (Using NFTs):

We could represent each piece of ad inventory as a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) on Solana. Each NFT would represent a specific, unique advertising opportunity.

Key Metadata for the Ad Inventory NFT:

publisher_id: Identifier linking to the publisher's on-chain profile/wallet.

inventory_id: A unique ID for this specific ad slot/package within the publisher's offerings.

platform_type: Enum (e.g., Website, MobileApp).

ad_format: Enum (e.g., Banner, Interstitial, Video, Native).

dimensions: String (e.g., "300x250", "728x90").

location_description: String (e.g., "Homepage Header", "Article Bottom", "App Feed Position 3").

unit_type: Enum (e.g., Impressions, Duration, Clicks - Note: Clicks are harder to guarantee/tokenize).

unit_quantity: Number (e.g., 10000 impressions, 24 hours).

start_time / end_time (Optional): Specific time window if applicable (more relevant for Duration).

base_price: Suggested starting price (in SOL or a stablecoin).

targeting_tags (Optional, Basic): Array of strings for basic categorization (e.g., ["sports", "news", "goa", "mobile-users"]). Complex targeting likely remains off-chain.

status: Enum (e.g., Listed, Sold, Expired, Delivered, Disputed).

Why NFTs?

Each ad slot or package is unique in its context (website, placement, time/volume).

Allows for clear ownership transfer.

Metadata can store the specific details of the inventory.

Alternative: Fungible Tokens?

Could represent batches of similar impressions (e.g., 1 token = 1000 impressions on any sports-related app in the network). This is simpler but less specific. Might be better for remnant inventory. Let's stick with NFTs for now as they map better to specific, desirable ad slots.

3. High-Level Actions:

1. Publisher: Lists inventory -> Mints an Ad Inventory NFT.

Advertiser: Browses listed NFTs -> Buys/Bids on an NFT.

Exchange: Facilitates the trade (escrow?, payment).
zPost-Sale: Advertiser provides ad creative -> Oracle verifies delivery -> Status updated / Funds released.

What do you think of this initial breakdown? Does the NFT approach for representing ad inventory make sense as a starting point? We can refine the metadata and think about the exchange mechanism next.
