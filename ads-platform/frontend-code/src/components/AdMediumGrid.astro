{/*
  This component displays a grid of advertising mediums.
  The grid is responsive, adjusting the number of columns based on screen size.
*/}

{/*
  **Explanation of the Code:**
  
  1. **Grid Layout**: The grid is set up to have 1 column on mobile devices, 2 columns on medium devices (like tablets), and 4 columns on large devices (like desktops).
  
  2. **Styling**: Each grid item has a light gray background, padding, rounded corners, and a shadow effect that changes on hover.
  
  3. **Text**: The text is centered and styled for readability.

{/*
  **Styling Classes Explained:**
  
  - `bg-gray-100`: Light gray background for the grid items.
  - `p-6`: Padding around the grid items.
  - `rounded-lg`: Rounded corners for the grid items.
  - `shadow-sm`: Small shadow effect for depth.
  - `text-center`: Centered text within each grid item.
  - `hover:shadow-md`: Increases shadow on hover for a subtle effect.
  - `transition-shadow duration-200`: Smooth transition effect for the shadow change.
*/}

{/*
  **Responsive Design**: The grid layout is responsive, meaning it will adapt to different screen sizes. 
  - On mobile devices, it shows 1 column.
  - On medium devices (like tablets), it switches to 2 columns.
  - On large devices (like desktops), it displays 4 columns.
